# Udacity Ajax

Udacity-Ajax is a fully complete, well documented version of the Udacity Ajax course's website project which uses the Google Maps API, New York Times API, and (unofficial) Wikipedia API.

The code is highly commented so that viewers can quickly understand everything that is going on, even with minimal prior Ajax experience.
